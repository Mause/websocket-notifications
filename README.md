websocket-notifications
=======================

Moderately simple websocket and python based webkit notifications pusher "system"

* Remake debug checkbox, enabled or disables debug output
* also, make sure that when debugging is not enable that the debug div is not visible

* Add/write machine/programmatic interface/client library for submitting new notifications to clients :D

* try and make deque serializable (looks like it will probably be a hack atm)
